# Brook-Trout-Data-Vis-and-ML

This project is a short summary of a multi year passion project looking at Maine's state herritage fish waters. These lakes and ponds are home to native self sustaining popultions of Brook Trout. A rare and culturally significant natural resource in the United States. In this project I create some data visualizations that allow for a better understanding of the geographic and ecoloogical distrubuitions of these ponds. Then I also show the final model in a experimental machine learing project I did to determine if data science and machine learning may have uses in fisheries or other wildlife managment. I created this as a short example of some of my work to be used in job applications. 

All nessary files can be found in this repository, instructions are commented in cells in the notebook.
